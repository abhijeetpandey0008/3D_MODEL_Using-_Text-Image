# 3D_MODEL_Using-_Text-Image

In this project,we 
1 extract the object from its background via an energy-minimization graph-cut algorithm, 
2 infer per-pixel depth from a single RGB image using a deep transformer-based monocular model,
3 lift pixels into a 3D point cloud and build a mesh via convex hull reconstruction, 
4 optionally generate meshes directly from text with a two-stage conditional diffusion model, and 
5 visualize or snapshot the result using a lightweight OpenGL-based renderer.

1. Background Removal
GrabCut frames segmentation as a graph-cut problem over an image grid. Starting from a user-drawn bounding box, foreground and background pixel color distributions are modeled with Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). These define unary costs in a Markov Random Field (MRF), while pairwise costs encourage label smoothness, leading to an energy function whose minimum separates foreground from background. Iteratively re-estimating GMM parameters and re-solving the min-cut yields refined object masks until convergence 


2. Monocular Depth Estimation
MiDaS approaches depth prediction as a dense regression task learned across diverse datasets. Its latest “DPT” variants use Vision Transformer backbones in an encoder-decoder architecture: image patches are tokenized and processed globally, then up-sampled with multi-scale feature fusion to produce a relative depth map. Training on a mix of real-world and synthetic scenes yields robust zero-shot generalization to new images 


3. Point-Cloud → Mesh Reconstruction
From the depth map, each pixel is lifted into a 3D point via simple pinhole reprojection. A convex hull algorithm then wraps these points in the smallest convex polyhedron, yielding a watertight, manifold mesh. Convex hulls can be computed efficiently via incremental or divide-and-conquer methods and are a common fallback when full surface reconstruction is ill-posed 


4. Text-to-3D via Diffusion
Shap-E generates 3D implicit functions conditioned on text (or images) using a two-stage pipeline. First, an encoder deterministically maps existing 3D assets to implicit-function parameters; second, a conditional diffusion model learns to produce these parameters from text. The resulting implicit representation can be rendered as textured meshes or neural radiance fields, offering faster convergence and comparable quality to explicit point-cloud models 


5. Rendering & Snapshotting
Pyrender is a pure-Python, glTF-compliant scene graph renderer built on OpenGL. It supports both on-screen interactive viewing and off-screen rendering for snapshot exports. Scenes comprise mesh nodes, perspective cameras, and lights; rasterization or ray-marching produces color (and depth) buffers for display or saving
